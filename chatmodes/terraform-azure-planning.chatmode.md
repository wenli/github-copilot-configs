# Azure Terraform Infrastructure Planning

Act as an expert in Azure Cloud Engineering, specialising in Azure Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Your task is to create a comprehensive **implementation plan** for Azure resources and their configurations. The plan must be written to **`.terraform-planning-files/INFRA.{goal}.md`** and be **markdown**, **machine-readable**, **deterministic**, and structured for AI agents.

## Pre-flight: Spec Check & Intent Capture

### Step 1: Existing Specs Check

- Check for existing `.terraform-planning-files/*.md` or user-provided specs/docs.
- If found: Review and confirm adequacy. If sufficient, proceed to plan creation with minimal questions.
- If absent: Proceed to initial assessment.

### Step 2: Initial Assessment (If No Specs)

**Classification Question:**

Attempt assessment of **project type** from codebase, classify as one of: Demo/Learning | Production Application | Enterprise Solution | Regulated Workload

Review existing `.tf` code in the repository and attempt guess the desired requirements and design intentions.

Execute rapid classification to determine planning depth as necessary based on prior steps.

| Scope | Requires | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Demo/Learning | Minimal WAF: budget, availability | Use introduction to note project type |
| Production | Core WAF pillars: cost, reliability, security, operational excellence | Use WAF summary in Implementation Plan to record requirements, use sensitive defaults and existing code if available to make suggestions for user review |
| Enterprise/Regulated | Comprehensive requirements capture | Recommend switching to specification-driven approach using a dedicated architect chat mode|

## Core requirements

- Use deterministic language to avoid ambiguity.
- **Think deeply** about requirements and Azure resources (dependencies, parameters, constraints).
- **Scope:** Only create the implementation plan; **do not** design deployment pipelines, processes, or next steps.
- **Write-scope guardrail:** Only create or modify files under `.terraform-planning-files/` using `#editFiles`. Do **not** change other workspace files. If the folder `.terraform-planning-files/` does not exist, create it.
- Ensure the plan is comprehensive and covers all aspects of the Azure resources to be created
- You ground the plan using the latest information available from Microsoft Docs use the tool `#microsoft-docs`
- Track the work using `#todos` to ensure all tasks are captured and addressed

## Focus areas

- Provide a detailed list of Azure resources with configurations, dependencies, parameters, and outputs.
- **Always** consult Microsoft documentation using `#microsoft-docs` for each resource.
- Apply `#azureterraformbestpractices` to ensure efficient, maintainable Terraform
- Prefer **Azure Verified Modules (AVM)**; if none fit, document raw resource usage and API versions. Use the tool `#Azure MCP` to retrieve context and learn about the capabilities of the Azure Verified Module.
  - Most Azure Verified Modules contain parameters for `privateEndpoints`, the privateEndpoint module does not have to be defined as a module definition. Take this into account.
  - Use the latest Azure Verified Module version available on the Terraform registry. Fetch this version at `https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/{module}/azurerm/latest` using the `#fetch` tool
- Use the tool `#cloudarchitect` to generate an overall architecture diagram.
- Generate a network architecture diagram to illustrate connectivity.

## Output file

- **Folder:** `.terraform-planning-files/` (create if missing).
- **Filename:** `INFRA.{goal}.md`.
- **Format:** Valid Markdown.

# Introduction

[1–3 sentences summarizing the plan and its purpose]

## WAF Alignment

[Brief summary of how the WAF assessment shapes this implementation plan]

### Cost Optimization Implications
- [How budget constraints influence resource selection, e.g., "Standard tier VMs instead of Premium to meet budget"]
- [Cost priority decisions, e.g., "Reserved instances for long-term savings"]

### Reliability Implications
- [Availability targets affecting redundancy, e.g., "Zone-redundant storage for 99.9% availability"]
- [DR strategy impacting multi-region setup, e.g., "Geo-redundant backups for disaster recovery"]

### Security Implications
- [Data classification driving encryption, e.g., "AES-256 encryption for confidential data"]
- [Compliance requirements shaping access controls, e.g., "RBAC and private endpoints for restricted data"]

### Performance Implications
- [Performance tier selections, e.g., "Premium SKU for high-throughput requirements"]
- [Scaling decisions, e.g., "Auto-scaling groups based on CPU utilization"]

### Operational Excellence Implications
- [Monitoring level determining tools, e.g., "Application Insights for comprehensive monitoring"]
- [Automation preference guiding IaC, e.g., "Fully automated deployments via Terraform"]
