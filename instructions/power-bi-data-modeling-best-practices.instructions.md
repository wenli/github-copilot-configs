# Power BI Data Modeling Best Practices

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive instructions for designing efficient, scalable, and maintainable Power BI semantic models following Microsoft's official guidance and dimensional modeling best practices.

## Star Schema Design Principles

### 1. Fundamental Table Types
**Dimension Tables** - Store descriptive business entities:
- Products, customers, geography, time, employees
- Contain unique key columns (preferably surrogate keys)
- Relatively small number of rows
- Used for filtering, grouping, and providing context
- Support hierarchical drill-down scenarios

**Fact Tables** - Store measurable business events:
- Sales transactions, website clicks, manufacturing events
- Contain foreign keys to dimension tables
- Numeric measures for aggregation
- Large number of rows (typically growing over time)
- Represent specific grain/level of detail

```
Example Star Schema Structure:

DimProduct (Dimension)          FactSales (Fact)              DimCustomer (Dimension)
├── ProductKey (PK)             ├── SalesKey (PK)             ├── CustomerKey (PK)
├── ProductName                 ├── ProductKey (FK)           ├── CustomerName
├── Category                    ├── CustomerKey (FK)          ├── CustomerType  
├── SubCategory                 ├── DateKey (FK)              ├── Region
└── UnitPrice                   ├── SalesAmount               └── RegistrationDate
                               ├── Quantity
DimDate (Dimension)             └── DiscountAmount
├── DateKey (PK)
├── Date
├── Year
├── Quarter
├── Month
└── DayOfWeek
```

### 2. Table Design Best Practices

#### Dimension Table Design
```
✅ DO:
- Use surrogate keys (auto-incrementing integers) as primary keys
- Include business keys for integration purposes
- Create hierarchical attributes (Category > SubCategory > Product)
- Use descriptive names and proper data types
- Include "Unknown" records for missing dimension data
- Keep dimension tables relatively narrow (focused attributes)

❌ DON'T:
- Use natural business keys as primary keys in large models
- Mix fact and dimension characteristics in same table
- Create unnecessarily wide dimension tables
- Leave missing values without proper handling
```

#### Fact Table Design
```
✅ DO:
- Store data at the most granular level needed
- Use foreign keys that match dimension table keys
- Include only numeric, measurable columns
- Maintain consistent grain across all fact table rows
- Use appropriate data types (decimal for currency, integer for counts)

❌ DON'T:
- Include descriptive text columns (these belong in dimensions)
- Mix different grains in the same fact table
- Store calculated values that can be computed at query time
- Use composite keys when surrogate keys would be simpler
```

## Relationship Design and Management

### 1. Relationship Types and Best Practices

#### One-to-Many Relationships (Standard Pattern)
```
Configuration:
- From Dimension (One side) to Fact (Many side)
- Single direction filtering (Dimension filters Fact)
- Mark as "Assume Referential Integrity" for DirectQuery performance

Example:
DimProduct (1) ← ProductKey → (*) FactSales
DimCustomer (1) ← CustomerKey → (*) FactSales
DimDate (1) ← DateKey → (*) FactSales
```

#### Many-to-Many Relationships (Use Sparingly)
```
When to Use:
✅ Genuine many-to-many business relationships
✅ When bridging table pattern is not feasible
✅ For advanced analytical scenarios

Best Practices:
- Create explicit bridging tables when possible
- Use low-cardinality relationship columns
- Monitor performance impact carefully
- Document business rules clearly

Example with Bridging Table:
DimCustomer (1) ← CustomerKey → (*) BridgeCustomerAccount (*) ← AccountKey → (1) DimAccount
```

#### One-to-One Relationships (Rare)
```
When to Use:
- Extending dimension tables with additional attributes
- Degenerate dimension scenarios
- Separating PII from operational data

Implementation:
- Consider consolidating into single table if possible
- Use for security/privacy separation
- Maintain referential integrity
```

### 2. Relationship Configuration Guidelines
```
Filter Direction:
✅ Single Direction: Default choice, best performance
✅ Both Directions: Only when cross-filtering is required for business logic
❌ Avoid: Circular relationship paths

Cross-Filter Direction:
- Dimension to Fact: Always single direction
- Fact to Fact: Avoid direct relationships, use shared dimensions
- Dimension to Dimension: Only when business logic requires it

Referential Integrity:
✅ Enable for DirectQuery sources when data quality is guaranteed  
✅ Improves query performance by using INNER JOINs
❌ Don't enable if source data has orphaned records
```

## Storage Mode Optimization

### 1. Import Mode Best Practices
```
When to Use Import Mode:
✅ Data size fits within capacity limits
✅ Complex analytical calculations required
✅ Historical data analysis with stable datasets
✅ Need for optimal query performance

Optimization Strategies:
- Remove unnecessary columns and rows
- Use appropriate data types
- Pre-aggregate data when possible
- Implement incremental refresh for large datasets
- Optimize Power Query transformations
```

#### Data Reduction Techniques for Import
```
Vertical Filtering (Column Reduction):
✅ Remove columns not used in reports or relationships
✅ Remove calculated columns that can be computed in DAX
✅ Remove intermediate columns used only in Power Query
✅ Optimize data types (Integer vs. Decimal, Date vs. DateTime)

Horizontal Filtering (Row Reduction):
✅ Filter to relevant time periods (e.g., last 3 years of data)
✅ Filter to relevant business entities (active customers, specific regions)
✅ Remove test, invalid, or cancelled transactions
✅ Implement proper data archiving strategies

Data Type Optimization:
Text → Numeric: Convert codes to integers when possible
DateTime → Date: Use Date type when time is not needed
Decimal → Integer: Use integers for whole number measures
High Precision → Lower Precision: Match business requirements
```

### 2. DirectQuery Mode Best Practices
```
When to Use DirectQuery Mode:
✅ Data exceeds import capacity limits
✅ Real-time data requirements
✅ Security/compliance requires data to stay at source
✅ Integration with operational systems

Optimization Requirements:
- Optimize source database performance
- Create appropriate indexes on source tables
- Minimize complex DAX calculations
- Use simple measures and aggregations
- Limit number of visuals per report page
- Implement query reduction techniques
```

#### DirectQuery Performance Optimization
```
Database Optimization:
✅ Create indexes on frequently filtered columns
✅ Create indexes on relationship key columns
✅ Use materialized views for complex joins
✅ Implement appropriate database maintenance
✅ Consider columnstore indexes for analytical workloads

Model Design for DirectQuery:
✅ Keep DAX measures simple
✅ Avoid calculated columns on large tables
✅ Use star schema design strictly
✅ Minimize cross-table operations
✅ Pre-aggregate data in source when possible

Query Performance:
✅ Apply filters early in report design
✅ Use appropriate visual types
✅ Limit high-cardinality filtering
✅ Monitor and optimize slow queries
```

### 3. Composite Model Design
```
When to Use Composite Models:
✅ Combine historical (Import) with real-time (DirectQuery) data
✅ Extend existing models with additional data sources
✅ Balance performance with data freshness requirements
✅ Integrate multiple DirectQuery sources

Storage Mode Selection:
Import: Small dimension tables, historical aggregated facts
DirectQuery: Large fact tables, real-time operational data  
Dual: Dimension tables that need to work with both Import and DirectQuery facts
Hybrid: Fact tables combining historical (Import) with recent (DirectQuery) data
```

#### Dual Storage Mode Strategy
```
Use Dual Mode For:
✅ Dimension tables that relate to both Import and DirectQuery facts
✅ Small, slowly changing reference tables
✅ Lookup tables that need flexible querying

Configuration:
- Set dimension tables to Dual mode
- Power BI automatically chooses optimal query path
- Maintains single copy of dimension data
- Enables efficient cross-source relationships
```

## Advanced Modeling Patterns

### 1. Date Table Design
```
Essential Date Table Attributes:
✅ Continuous date range (no gaps)
✅ Mark as date table in Power BI
✅ Include standard hierarchy (Year > Quarter > Month > Day)
✅ Add business-specific columns (FiscalYear, WorkingDay, Holiday)
✅ Use Date data type for date column

Date Table Implementation:
DateKey (Integer): 20240315 (YYYYMMDD format)
Date (Date): 2024-03-15
Year (Integer): 2024
Quarter (Text): Q1 2024
Month (Text): March 2024  
MonthNumber (Integer): 3
DayOfWeek (Text): Friday
IsWorkingDay (Boolean): TRUE
FiscalYear (Integer): 2024
FiscalQuarter (Text): FY2024 Q3
```

### 2. Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)
```
Type 1 SCD (Overwrite):
- Update existing records with new values
- Lose historical context
- Simple to implement and maintain
- Use for non-critical attribute changes

Type 2 SCD (History Preservation):
- Create new records for changes
- Maintain complete history
- Include effective date ranges
- Use surrogate keys for unique identification

Implementation Pattern:
CustomerKey (Surrogate): 1, 2, 3, 4
CustomerID (Business): 101, 101, 102, 103  
CustomerName: "John Doe", "John Smith", "Jane Doe", "Bob Johnson"
EffectiveDate: 2023-01-01, 2024-01-01, 2023-01-01, 2023-01-01
ExpirationDate: 2023-12-31, 9999-12-31, 9999-12-31, 9999-12-31
IsCurrent: FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE
```

### 3. Role-Playing Dimensions
```
Scenario: Date table used for Order Date, Ship Date, Delivery Date

Implementation Options:

Option 1: Multiple Relationships (Recommended)
- Single Date table with multiple relationships to Fact
- One active relationship (Order Date)
- Inactive relationships for Ship Date and Delivery Date
- Use USERELATIONSHIP in DAX measures

Option 2: Multiple Date Tables
- Separate tables: OrderDate, ShipDate, DeliveryDate
- Each with dedicated relationship
- More intuitive for report authors
- Larger model size due to duplication

DAX Implementation:
Sales by Order Date = [Total Sales]  // Uses active relationship
Sales by Ship Date = CALCULATE([Total Sales], USERELATIONSHIP(FactSales[ShipDate], DimDate[Date]))
Sales by Delivery Date = CALCULATE([Total Sales], USERELATIONSHIP(FactSales[DeliveryDate], DimDate[Date]))
```

### 4. Bridge Tables for Many-to-Many
```
Scenario: Students can be in multiple Courses, Courses can have multiple Students

Bridge Table Design:
DimStudent (1) ← StudentKey → (*) BridgeStudentCourse (*) ← CourseKey → (1) DimCourse

Bridge Table Structure:
StudentCourseKey (PK): Surrogate key
StudentKey (FK): Reference to DimStudent
CourseKey (FK): Reference to DimCourse  
EnrollmentDate: Additional context
Grade: Additional context
Status: Active, Completed, Dropped

Relationship Configuration:
- DimStudent to BridgeStudentCourse: One-to-Many
- BridgeStudentCourse to DimCourse: Many-to-One  
- Set one relationship to bi-directional for filter propagation
- Hide bridge table from report view
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### 1. Model Size Optimization
```
Column Optimization:
✅ Remove unused columns completely
✅ Use smallest appropriate data types
✅ Convert high-cardinality text to integers with lookup tables
✅ Remove redundant calculated columns

Row Optimization:  
✅ Filter to business-relevant time periods
✅ Remove invalid, test, or cancelled transactions
✅ Archive historical data appropriately
✅ Use incremental refresh for growing datasets

Aggregation Strategies:
✅ Pre-calculate common aggregations
✅ Use summary tables for high-level reporting
✅ Implement automatic aggregations in Premium
✅ Consider OLAP cubes for complex analytical requirements
```

### 2. Relationship Performance
```
Key Selection:
✅ Use integer keys over text keys
✅ Prefer surrogate keys over natural keys
✅ Ensure referential integrity in source data
✅ Create appropriate indexes on key columns

Cardinality Optimization:
✅ Set correct relationship cardinality
✅ Use "Assume Referential Integrity" when appropriate
✅ Minimize bidirectional relationships
✅ Avoid many-to-many relationships when possible

Cross-Filtering Strategy:
✅ Use single-direction filtering as default
✅ Enable bi-directional only when required
✅ Test performance impact of cross-filtering
✅ Document business reasons for bi-directional relationships
```

### 3. Query Performance Patterns
```
Efficient Model Patterns:
✅ Proper star schema implementation
✅ Normalized dimension tables
✅ Denormalized fact tables
✅ Consistent grain across related tables
✅ Appropriate use of calculated tables and columns

Query Optimization:
✅ Pre-filter large datasets
✅ Use appropriate visual types for data
✅ Minimize complex DAX in reports
✅ Leverage model relationships effectively
✅ Consider DirectQuery for large, real-time datasets
```

## Security and Governance

### 1. Row-Level Security (RLS)
```
Implementation Patterns:

User-Based Security:
[UserEmail] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()

Role-Based Security:  
VAR UserRole = 
    LOOKUPVALUE(
        UserRoles[Role],
        UserRoles[Email],
        USERPRINCIPALNAME()
    )
RETURN
    Customers[Region] = UserRole

Dynamic Security:
LOOKUPVALUE(
    UserRegions[Region],
    UserRegions[Email], 
    USERPRINCIPALNAME()
) = Customers[Region]

Best Practices:
✅ Test with different user accounts
✅ Keep security logic simple and performant
✅ Document security requirements clearly
✅ Use security roles, not individual user filters
✅ Consider performance impact of complex RLS
```

### 2. Data Governance
```
Documentation Requirements:
✅ Business definitions for all measures
✅ Data lineage and source system mapping
✅ Refresh schedules and dependencies
✅ Security and access control documentation
✅ Change management procedures

Data Quality:
✅ Implement data validation rules
✅ Monitor for data completeness
✅ Handle missing values appropriately
✅ Validate business rule implementation
✅ Regular data quality assessments

Version Control:
✅ Source control for Power BI files
✅ Environment promotion procedures
✅ Change tracking and approval processes
✅ Backup and recovery procedures
```

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Schema Anti-Patterns
```
❌ Snowflake Schema (Unless Necessary):
- Multiple normalized dimension tables
- Complex relationship chains
- Reduced query performance
- More complex for business users

❌ Single Large Table:
- Mixing facts and dimensions
- Denormalized to extreme
- Difficult to maintain and extend
- Poor performance for analytical queries

❌ Multiple Fact Tables with Direct Relationships:
- Many-to-many between facts
- Complex filter propagation
- Difficult to maintain consistency
- Better to use shared dimensions
```

### 2. Relationship Anti-Patterns  
```
❌ Bidirectional Relationships Everywhere:
- Performance impact
- Unpredictable filter behavior
- Maintenance complexity
- Should be exception, not rule

❌ Many-to-Many Without Business Justification:
- Often indicates missing dimension
- Can hide data quality issues
- Complex debugging and maintenance
- Bridge tables usually better solution

❌ Circular Relationships:
- Ambiguous filter paths
- Unpredictable results
- Difficult debugging
- Always avoid through proper design
```

## Advanced Data Modeling Patterns

### 1. Slowly Changing Dimensions Implementation
```powerquery
// Type 1 SCD: Power Query implementation for hash-based change detection
let
    Source = Source,

    #"Added custom" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(
        Table.AddColumn(Source, "Hash", each Binary.ToText( 
            Text.ToBinary( 
                Text.Combine(
                    List.Transform({[FirstName],[LastName],[Region]}, each if _ = null then "" else _),
                "|")),
            BinaryEncoding.Hex)
        ),
        {{"Hash", type text}}
    ),

    #"Marked key columns" = Table.AddKey(#"Added custom", {"Hash"}, false),

    #"Merged queries" = Table.NestedJoin(
        #"Marked key columns",
        {"Hash"},
        ExistingDimRecords,
        {"Hash"},
        "ExistingDimRecords",
        JoinKind.LeftOuter
    ),

    #"Expanded ExistingDimRecords" = Table.ExpandTableColumn(
        #"Merged queries",
        "ExistingDimRecords",
        {"Count"},
        {"Count"}
    ),

    #"Filtered rows" = Table.SelectRows(#"Expanded ExistingDimRecords", each ([Count] = null)),

    #"Removed columns" = Table.RemoveColumns(#"Filtered rows", {"Count"})
in
    #"Removed columns"
```

### 2. Incremental Refresh with Query Folding
```powerquery
// Optimized incremental refresh pattern
let
  Source = Sql.Database("server","database"),
  Data  = Source{[Schema="dbo",Item="FactInternetSales"]}[Data],
  FilteredByStart = Table.SelectRows(Data, each [OrderDateKey] >= Int32.From(DateTime.ToText(RangeStart,[Format="yyyyMMdd"]))),
  FilteredByEnd = Table.SelectRows(FilteredByStart, each [OrderDateKey] < Int32.From(DateTime.ToText(RangeEnd,[Format="yyyyMMdd"])))
in
  FilteredByEnd
```

### 3. Semantic Link Integration
```python
# Working with Power BI semantic models in Python
import sempy.fabric as fabric
from sempy.relationships import plot_relationship_metadata

relationships = fabric.list_relationships("my_dataset")
plot_relationship_metadata(relationships)
```

### 4. Advanced Partition Strategies
```json
// TMSL partition with time-based filtering
"partition": {
      "name": "Sales2019",
      "mode": "import",
      "source": {
        "type": "m",
        "expression": [
          "let",
          "    Source = SqlDatabase,",
          "    dbo_Sales = Source{[Schema=\"dbo\",Item=\"Sales\"]}[Data],",
          "    FilteredRows = Table.SelectRows(dbo_Sales, each [OrderDateKey] >= 20190101 and [OrderDateKey] <= 20191231)",
          "in",
          "    FilteredRows"
        ]
      }
}
```

Remember: Always validate your model design with business users and test with realistic data volumes and usage patterns. Use Power BI's built-in tools like Performance Analyzer and DAX Studio for optimization and debugging.
